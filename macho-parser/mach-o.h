 * allows the zeroed segment padding to be mapped into memory where zero fill
 * sections might be. The gigabyte zero fill sections, those with the section
 * type S_GB_ZEROFILL, can only be in a segment with sections of this type.
 * These segments are then placed after all other segments.
 *

 * compactness.  There is no padding to a specified segment boundary and the
 * mach_header and load commands are not part of the segment.
 *
 * Sections with the same section name, sectname, going into the same segment,
 * segname, are combined by the link editor.  The resulting section is aligned
 * to the maximum alignment of the combined sections and is the new section's
 * alignment.  The combined sections are aligned to their original alignment in
 * the combined section.  Any padded bytes to get the specified alignment are
 * zeroed.
